## About Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator, meaning a  program that takes source files and converts them into a static website.
It implies less complexity: you only need to know  html, css and js (and a little liquid).

## Install on Windows

Open the command prompt as administrator and install Chocolatey, which is a package manager for Windows.
```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
```

Close and open the command prompt again to ensure that Chocolatey is in the path. Install Ruby:
```
choco install ruby -y
```
Close and open again to make sure Ruby is on the path. Install Jekyll as a gem:
```
  gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
  gem sources -a http://rubygems.org/
  gem install jekyll
```

## Host the Website on GitHub Pages

The website’s code will be on Github. First create a new repository. Then tweak the repo to work as a host website, by creating a new branch, in settings called **gh-pages**.
Change the default branch to gh-pages. Optionally, delete the master branch, which is no longer needed.

Clone the project. Create a **_config.yml** file inside the project folder, needed to configure Jekyll. Set the baseurl to the name of your project:
```
baseurl: /study-notes
exclude: ['README.md']   //optional
```

## Run Jekyll

From inside the project folder open the command prompt and type:

```
jekyll serve --watch --baseurl “”
```
Single quotes after baseurl worked for me, double ones did not. Leave it running. You can setup a gitignore file and add the _site folder, created by Jakyll.

## Jekyll File Structure
**_config.yml** - holds the configuration for the site. Usually used to hold variables referenced throughout the site and to specify runtime variables<br>
**_drafts** - holds all the draft posts - work on a blog post without having it published to the site <br>
**_includes** - partial parts of a page, included throughout the site (used for page sections duplicated throughout the site)<br>
**_layouts** - templates that wrap around our content<br>
**_posts** - contain the blog posts, usually written in markdown<br>
**_data** - contains yml, json or csv files and the data inside can be used throughout the site<br>

## Front Matter
```
---
title: Post Title
fruit:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
vegetables:
  - name: onion
    cost: $1
  - name: cucumber
    cost: $2
  - name: cabbage
    cost: $3
---
```
YAML information goes in between a set of three dashes at the top of the file. Whatever is included here can be used throughout the page.
<br><br>It can contain variables, arrays (each item starts with a hyphen, then the name; two spaces before the hyphen, not a tab, YAML doesn’t like tabs) and objects: key-value pairs.
<br><br>
**.size** gets the number of elements; **site.posts[34].title** gets the title of the item at index 34.

## Liquid

There are two types of markup in Liquid: Output and Tag.

**Output** markup (which may resolve to text) is surrounded by matched pairs of curly brackets (ie, braces)
```
{{ "{{page.title"}}}}
```
**Tag** markup (which cannot resolve to text) is surrounded by matched pairs of curly brackets and percent signs.
```
{{ "{% if page.draft === true " }}%}
```

## Layout

Layouts are used for content shared on multiple pages (like a master page in InDesign), to eliminate duplicate content (eg. header, footer, sidebar).
<br><br>
Create a new directory **_layouts** and a new file **default.html**. This page will include the content that is common on all pages.
<br><br>
Insert the placeholder variable `{{ "{{ content " }}}}` in **default.html**'s body. This is where the content of the page will go.
<br><br>
In **index.html**, at the top include the special variable layout to specify the layout for this page.
```
---
layout: default
---
```

## Includes

Includes are used to share snippets of code on multiple pages, thus reducing duplication.
<br><br>
Create a directory **_includes** and an **.html** file with the snippet to be reused. Inside the page where you want the code to be used insert the tag:
```
{{ "{% include nav.html " }}%}  // nav.html is the snippet of code to be included
```
You can also pass information into the included snippet, using parameters:

```
//navclass is the name of the parameter and nav-top is the value
{{ "{% include nav.html navclass='nav-top'" }} %}
```

And in the included snippet:
```
<ul class="nav {{ "{{include.navclass"}}}}">
```
## Posts
Posts are organized reverse chronologically. You might use them for blog posts on a personal blog, or articles on a news site.
<br><br>
Posts live in the **_posts** directory, and are always named in the form of **YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md**.
Naming convention: 4 digits for year, followed by a dash, 2 digits for the month, dash and two digits for day, dash, title of post (eg: **2017-03-01-new-post.md**).
<br><br>
In the post, at the top:
```
---
layout: post
title: A blog post
meta: a short description
category: post
---
```
You can use a for loop to iterate over the posts and output a list of links for navigation, for example:
```
{{ "{% for post in site.posts "}}%}
    <li>
       <a href="{{ "{{site.baseurl"}}}}{{ "{{post.url"}}}}">{{ " {{post.title" }}}} </a>
       <p>{{ " {{post.meta" }}}}</p>
    </li>
{{ "{% endfor "}}%}
```
Use **site.baseurl** in front of all links to ensure they work consistently in multiple locations (prevent any problems that might appear after putting the files in folders).
<br>
To limit the number of posts that display when looping over all the posts, we can use **limit**.
```
{{" {% for post in site.categories.news limit:2 "}} %}
```

## Control Flow

Can use **if**:
```
{{ "{% if cupcake.type == "Lemon" " }}%}
    // some code
{{ "{% elsif cupcake.rating == 5 " }}%}
    //some code
{{ "{% endif " }}%}

//also has unless
{{ "{% unless cupcake.rating >= 3 " }}%}
```
Can filter by **contains**:
```
{{ "{% if cupcake.type contains "Chocolate" " }}%}
```
Can use case:
```
{{ "{% case cupcake.rating " }}%}
    {{ "{% when 1 " }}%}
        // some code
    {{ "{% when 2 " }}%}
        // some other code
    {{ "{% else " }}%}
        // some other code
{{ "{% endcase " }}%}
```
Can use the words **or** & **and**.
Can use **break** or **continue**.

There are also some helper variables available: forloop.length, .index, index0, .first, .last, etc.

## Data Files
In addition to the built-in variables available from Jekyll, you can specify your own custom data that can be accessed via the Liquid templating system. They are great for making ordered lists of non-post stuff.
<br><br>
Jekyll supports the .yml, .csv and .json files. They should be placed in a new directory called **_data**.
<br>
In **_data/authors.yml**:

```
- name: John Smith
  github: jsmith

- name: Jane Doe
  github: janed

- name: Rick Astley
  github: rickroll
```
In files throughout the site these elements can be accessed via **site.data.authors**.

## Collections

Collections are a powerful way to organize content on your site Everything that’s not a post or a page can be represented as a collection.
<br><br>
You can define a new collection in **_config.yml**.
```
collections:
  my_collection:
    foo: bar
```
Documents (the items in a collection) live in a folder in the root of your site named **_collection_name**, in this case it’s **_my_collection**.

## Variable Assignment

The simplest way to create a variable is with the assign tag:
```
{{ " {% assign name = 'freestyle' " }}%}
```

## Post Categories
Instead of placing posts inside of folders, you can specify one or more categories that the post belongs to. When the site is generated, the post will act as though it had been set with these categories normally.
<br><br>
Categories (plural key) can be specified as a YAML list or a space-separated string. You can use these categories to filter the content on the website.
```
{{ " {% for post in site.categories.news " }}%}
```

## Permalinks
If you need your processed blog post URLs to be something other than the site-wide style (default **/year/month/day/title.html**), then you can set the **permalink** variable in front matter and it will be used as the final URL.
```
---
layout: default
title: Blog
permalink: /blog/
---
```
If we wanted to set a permalink for all our blog posts, we could add this permalink to every blog post, but a better way is to set it once for all blog posts in **_config.yml**.
```
permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/   //result:  /blog/2009/04/29/slap-chop/
```
If we want pretty URLs (that don’t display the **.html** extension) we can use:
```
permalink: pretty
```
## Filters

Use various filters to modify the output. With a pipe character ( | ).
<br>
Optionally, a colon (:) and a comma-separated list of additional parameters to the filter.
<br><br>
eg: capitalize, ceil, date, downcase, escape, first, floor, join, jsonify,  last, modulo, remove, remove_first, replace, reverse, slice, sort, split, strip, truncate, upcase
```
{{ "{{ 'apple pie' | upcase " }}}}	// outputs APPLE PIE
```
## Highlight Navigation

We can use a Jekyll if statement to pass a css class that highlights the page we are currently on:
```
class =" {{ " {% if page.url == '/news.html' " }}%} current {{ " {% endif " }}%}
```
To highlight navigation on multiple pages, we can use **contains** instead of ==.

## Date formatting
We can include a date in the front matter, that we can then format on our pages.
<br>
```
---
layout: default
title: Date Formatting
date: 2016-03-23T10:20:00Z
---
```
```
{{ "{{ page.date | date_to_long_string " }}}}    //outputs  23 March 2016
{{ "{{ page.date | date_to_rfc822 " }}}}         //outputs Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:20:00 +1300
{{ "{{ page.date | date_to_string  " }}}}        //outputs 23 Mar 2016
{{ "{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema  " }}}}     //outputs 2016-03-23T23:20:00+13:00
```
**date** gives us complete control of the format. We can specify a template of the format we want. For example.
```
{{ "{{ page.date | date: '%m/%d/%Y' " }}}}   //outputs 03/23/2016
```
## Nested Layouts

You can have nested layouts by extending other layouts. An example of when this is helpful is if you have a sub section of your website with a common navigation, but it still has the websites main navigation.
<br><br>
In the **_layouts** directory we just need to make two files, like this:
```
_layouts/
  └ default.html
  └ sub-section.html
```
The page should point to the sub-section layout, and the sub-section layout should point to the default layout.
## Adding CSS

Don’t forget to include site.baseurl.

<link href="{{" {{site.baseurl "}}}}/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">

If we want to break the css into multiple files:

Move the **css** directory into the **_includes** directory.
Create a new css folder in the root folder.
Create a **main.css** in the css folder with jekyll **includes** of the css pieces.
```
---
---
{{ " {% include css/common.css " }}%}
{{ " {% include css/nav.css " }}%}
{{ " {% include css/header.css " }}%}
```
## Reading Time
If we want to display an estimate about how many minutes it takes to read a certain post:
<br><br>
First we need to calculate how many word are on the page using the **number_of_words** filter. Then we can divide the number of words by 180 (the average number of words per minute a human reads at) and we have an estimated read time.
<br><br>
We also need to handle the case where the estimated read time is less than 2 minutes (360 words). In this case we’ll show “1 min”.
```
{{" {% assign words = content | number_of_words"}} %}
{{" {% if words < 360 "}}%}
  1 min
{{" {% else "}}%}
{{"   {{ words | divided_by:180 "}} }} mins
{{" {% endif "}} %}
```
# Markdown

It’s a plain text formatting language that allows us to add basic formatting semantics to the text that we are writing. It is human readable, unlike html, and it only has a few symbols.
<br><br>
**Basics**:
<br><br>
Use hashtags for headings - #h1, ## h2, ### h3, up to 6
<br>
Use a dash and space for list (- )
<br>
Use numbers to make an ordered list
<br>
You can create a nested lists with tabs
<br>
Use ** to bold words
<br>
Use * to italicize words
<br>
Use --- (three dashes) to create a horizontal rule
<br>
To create a link use a pair of square brackets (for the text to be displayed) and a pair of round brackets (for the url).
```
A [link](http://example.com "Title").
```
To display images use an exclamation mark,a pair of square brackets (for the alt text) and a pair of round brackets (for the url)
```
Logo: ![Alt](/wp.png "Title")
```
You can also put plain html inside a markdown file.
\`\`\`  \`\`\` -> to put code put the type after the 1st set of backquotes for syntax highlighting \`\`\`html   \`\`\`.
<br>
For inline code use only one back quote \`<p>\`.
<br>
We can create tasklist, but they are not always supported: - [ ] and - [x] if completed
