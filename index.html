This site was inspired by <a class="link" href="http://monami555.github.io/">Mona's learning blog</a>. I stumbled upon her page while preparing for the Oracle Certified Associate exam. I found the idea of keeping a study blog very interesting seeing as I also enjoy taking notes while studying from books, courses or video tutorials.
